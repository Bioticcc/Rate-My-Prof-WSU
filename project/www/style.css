/*THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS WERE MADE BY CHAT GPT: .overlay-root and .overlay-card
    -Used gpt to generate a default template for the css styles to act as an overlay.
    -Manually edited colors and size.
    What the AI is doing here is making those classes I mentioned in ui.R earlier. When we set those tags$div containers to certain
    classes, this is where we actually make those classes exist. By setting the overlays design to overlay-root and overlay-card,
    we allow ourselves to simply make any changes we like in style.css without touching the core code in UI. We could also just be doing this
    by slotting in tags$head scripts, but that gets very messy very quickly, and this is very much so preferable.
