 * Feature 3: Stylized navigation bar to provide better feel of website
 * Feature 4: Stylized homepage with placeholders for future reference
 * FEature 5: User profiles, so login system actually shows you something

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
 We began the sprint with just simple planning and idea phases. We used AI to generate premade website UI designs to get an idea for future improvements we could make, and to get an understanding of what looks unnatural or bad for design choices. Unfortunately, we then sort of forgot the sprint was happening until the last week, at witch point exams were happening. This is not to give excuses, to be clear, just to highlight the reason for this being somewhat rushed. We decided then that we needed to set up a few things for the website, before other projects could begin. For example, the website framework needed to be done before the UI stylizing, and the login system needed to be done before we could add user profiles. We did the tasks in that order, meeting throughout the week to ensure things got done.

## Unfinished Work
The login system was unfinished in the video recording, but has since been completed. As has the user profile. Neither were in the demo video however, so images will be included in the document we submit.
